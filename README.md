The main objectives of this project include identifying relevant health and lifestyle factors that influence stroke risk, such as age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking, and diabetes. By leveraging supervised machine learning algorithms, this study investigates the predictive capabilities of models like Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Decision Trees (CART), and Random Forests.
